# WEB/CWEB on the web?

Welcome!

There is no code in this repository; it was created just for discussion. [**Click here to see all discussions**](https://github.com/shreevatsa/webWEB/discussions).

If you are interested in parsing WEB/CWEB files, or in presenting them in HTML form instead of PDF or print output, please join in!

## What is this?

WEB and CWEB are systems developed by Donald Knuth for literate programming. In these systems, the source file that the programmer types is converted into either 

- (by a program called (c)tangle) a form suitable for the compiler (a `.pas` or `.c` source file), or

- (by a program called (c)weave) a form suitable for humans to read. (This typeset ("woven") document is actually a `.tex` source file to be either printed or converted into PDF.)

But some of us would like to work with the programs in a different way than these tools (c)tangle/(c)weave provide: either parse the programs and tangle them differently, or produce HTML output instead of PDF, say.

If you are interested or can help, [**join in**](https://github.com/shreevatsa/webWEB/discussions): reply to one of the existing discussions or start a new one.
